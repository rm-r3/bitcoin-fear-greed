🧠 Bitcoin Fear & Greed

Neural Network Powered Sentiment Analysis

How it works

This project runs a small neural network directly in the browser to classify Bitcoin market sentiment.
The model learns patterns from historical market data and Fear & Greed Index values and predicts one of five sentiment classes:
	•	Extreme Fear
	•	Fear
	•	Neutral
	•	Greed
	•	Extreme Greed

The goal is educational and exploratory — to demonstrate how client-side machine learning can be applied to market sentiment analysis.

Training data

The model is trained on a static historical dataset (2018–2023) compiled from public sources:
	•	Fear & Greed Index — Alternative.me
	•	Bitcoin price & volume — Yahoo Finance

The dataset was published on Kaggle by Adil Bhatti and combines sentiment indicators with market data for supervised learning.

Training happens locally in the browser using this static dataset.

⸻

Live data (optional)

You can fetch current Bitcoin price and 24h volume from CoinGecko to generate a prediction for “right now”.
	•	Live data is used only for inference
	•	It is not added to the training dataset
	•	No data is stored or sent anywhere

⸻

Model & tech stack
	•	p5.js — UI & interaction
	•	ml5.js / TensorFlow.js — Feedforward neural network (classification)
	•	PapaParse — CSV parsing

Everything runs 100% client-side:
	•	No server
	•	No accounts
	•	No tracking

### Model limitations
This project is intentionally simple and has several important limitations:

- **Static training data**  
  The model is trained on historical data (2018–2023). It does not continuously learn or adapt to new market conditions.

- **Limited feature set**  
  Only date, price, volume, and Fear & Greed labels are used. Many influential factors such as macroeconomics, on-chain metrics, news events, or order book data are not included.

- **Sentiment ≠ price prediction**  
  The model predicts *market sentiment categories*, not future price movements. High confidence does not imply market direction.

- **Correlation, not causation**  
  The neural network learns correlations in past data. It does not understand causal relationships or external events.

- **No performance guarantees**  
  Like all machine learning models, results can be noisy, biased, or misleading — especially during unusual market regimes.

This project is designed for **learning, experimentation, and interface exploration**, not for real-world trading or financial decision-making.
